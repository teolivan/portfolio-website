                        <br />

                        I am interested in backend development, AI & machine learning, and electronics/robotics.  
                        I am more drawn to the lower-level stuff, and my aim is to gain enough knowledge to work within IoT or Robotics. 
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        During my free time, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, reading, painting, and hiking. 
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        I enjoy solving problems, so I like to do competitive programming, and let out my creative side making procedural art with p5js or Processing. 
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        My current focus is to gain more knowledge of embedded systems programming and AI.
